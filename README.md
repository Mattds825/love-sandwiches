# Love Sandwiches

A command line Python application to handle data automation for
a fictional company, using a google sheets document.
Part of the CodeInstitute Level 5 Web Application Development course

## Project Goals

Love Sandwiches runs a local market stall, selling a small range of sandwiches.

For each market day, their staff pre-make stock to sell. If they sell out of a particular sandwich, their staff
make extra for their customers. And the unsold ones are thrown away at the end of the day.

Our job is to write a Python program that will collect the companyâ€™s market day sales data,
calculate the surplus for the day, and produce recommendations for the number of each sandwich
to make for the next market. 

The goal is to save the company staff time by automating a
repetitive task, and help reduce the surplus by better predicting sales for future markets.

To achieve this, we will wire up our Python program to interact with a Google Sheet,
so that we can push and pull data to and from the spreadsheet.
